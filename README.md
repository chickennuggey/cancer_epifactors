# Epigenetic Factor of Cancer Types using different types of clustering

Based on the following paper: [Pan-cancer landscape of epigenetic factor expression predicts tumor outcome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05459-w#data-availability)

### Current status of this research
The research provides a pan-cancer analysis of epigenetic factors across 24 adult cancer types, using TCGA to explore their impact on tumor heterogeneity and patient outcomes. 
It uncovers distinct clusters of tumors based on epigenetic factor expressions, which correlate with prognostic implications, suggesting potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 
The study helps with understanding the epigenetic landscapeâ€™s role in cancer.

### Question
How does the expression of epi-factor genes across five pediatric cancer types using different clustering algorithms and neural networks to analyze complex patterns within gene expression data?

### Methodology
#### Data Collection
#### Filtering
#### K-Means Clustering
#### Neural Networks

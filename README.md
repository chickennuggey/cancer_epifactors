# Epigenetic Factor of Cancer Types using different types of clustering

Questions: How does the NMF clustering architecture differ from alternative clustering techniques such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering?
Would sampling for particular cancer subtypes determine an alternative structure of the respective clusters from NMF clustering? 

Based on the following paper: [Pan-cancer landscape of epigenetic factor expression predicts tumor outcome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05459-w#data-availability)
